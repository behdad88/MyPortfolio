    "When I first heard about data science, I did not really sure where should I start and what the path is to become a Data Scientist. After countless hours of research my conclusion about what the job consists of was unclear. What I had discovered in my research was how this job title is rapidly growing into a demanding career option. Living in a time of enormous amounts of data, more and more companies are in demand and looking to fill this position. I began to question, how do you become a data scientist, what degree or level of education do you need, what skills are employers looking for? This lead me to explore the job applications, backgrounds, experiences, and skills that the current data scientist possess. So the data analysis begins!\n",
    "first, I scrape LinkedIn job and I supposed with this I would gather job descriptions and key skills demanding. Second I am going to scrape individuals who land the job as a Data Scientist.\n",
    "For the first part I will go with getting insights from job descriptions. Let ‘s start scraping!\n"

Selenium has a restriction on its speed because the scraping with the browser is much slower.

Following my graduation, I've promptly relocated in NZ where I've worked as Data Analyst for three years, receiving the full sponsorship for the work visa from the company. I'm a passionate and avid learner, with the passion for analytics and machine learning. Being Kaggle one of my favourite hobbies, as at May 2014 I've ranked 14th out of other 170,000 data scientists in the whole community. With the goal of making this hobby my work, I’ve moved to London in 2014 to join Expedia as a Data Scientist. I'm now at Google as Data Science & Machine Learning consultant for their clients!\n",

      "Competing actively on Kaggle, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of real-world projects such as recommend Allstate's car insurance plan configuration, placing 2nd out 1,571 in the contest. Predict the auction price for piece of heavy equipment (2/476). Develop a real-time agent to recommend US domestic plane's route based on the current weather and air traffic condition (8/130). Model the automation of resources’ access for Amazon's employee (25/1687). Estimate how useful Yelp’s reviews will become overtime (15/350). Identify customer \"telematic fingerprint\" capable of distinguishing when a car trip was driven by a given driver (27/1528). Smartphone user recognition based on handset handling (36/633). \n",

      "After working on land rigs in Canada (2004/5) as a wellsite geologist, I decided to attend the Petroleum Geosciences Masters course at Imperial College, London. After graduation in 2006 I worked for Helix RDS (now owned by Baker Hughes), a subsurface consultancy who advise the oil and gas sector with technical reviews in the development and exploration for new fields. RDS put me through an intensive post grad training program exposing me to a wide range of different specialist disciplines including Geophysics, Petrophysics and Geology. Having completed my training, my goals were to expand my knowledge across these disciplines, whilst specialising in field exploration and development. This allowed me to increase my capability to bridge essential gaps between Geophysics, Petrophysics and Geology, facilitating an increase in understanding and communications amongst multidisciplinary teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked for Rathlin Energy (UK) Limited, an exploration company who hold two onshore UK licences. Rathlin recently drilled two wells in their Humberside license PEDL 183, of which I personally oversaw as Operations Geologist onsite. I went on to prepare and analyse the large data set these wells produced after they were drilled. \n",

      "Master Project: investigates the effects of varying geographic scale in the accuracy of variable selection using regularised regression methods, motivated by the gaps in the research about the impact of applying regularisation on data that are dependent of geographic scale. The goal was to explore, compare and inform pattern in the regularised methods (Lasso, Ridge, Lasso-Lar and Elastic Net) by adding the geographical scale as a variable.

      " My current work in Fastly involves extending the functionality in workflow managers (e.g. Apache Airflow) so that they can be used as both ETL and computational orchestration platforms. In addition, I am creating BigQuery-based analytic pipelines to drive automated, performance-based traffic engineering and DNS request mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "My work in BSkyB involved helping the company plan better for network capacity and reduce failure-related risk. I created python code that programatically creates large numbers of what-if routing failure scenarios on a time-changing network topology and runs them in parallel, collating the results and performing statistical analysis. I also created software that processes Netflow data and flexibly compares large numbers of statistical forecasting models to find out how different traffic sources are bound to grow, contract, or mix. I have also applied decision-tree classifiers and regressors to better understand video QoE.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main tools of the trade are python (e.g. pandas, scipy, multiprocessing, sklearn, etc) and dynamically generated SQL - using an ORM if available, and using jinja2 and/or direct string processing if not. R/ggplot2, Octave/Matlab and Seaborn/Matplotlib when needed. Java, perl and javascript if absolutely necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I obtained my PhD in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from UCL. Previously, I worked with an Operational Support Systems (OSS) integrator in Mexico, coding and integrating performance and fault management software for large telecommunications service providers (e.g. AT&T/Telefonica) and large equipment vendors (e.g. Ericsson/Hewlett-Packard).\n",
      "\n",
      "My PhD research focused on the incentives of peer-to-peer overlays. This basically means the exploration of the connections between the design of network protocols and the modelling of the behaviours of the rational, autonomous agents that use them.\n",

Over four years of professional experience I have developed great time-management and prioritization skills, and a natural predisposition to interpret and creatively combine largely diverse types of data into meaningful geospatial products. Using both commercial and open source GIS and image analysis tools, combined with strong analytical skills I have confidently delivered progress reports and presentations to both internal and external partners and clients. Feeling at ease working in both small teams and larger, distributed efforts, I have a natural inclination to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and show leader-like qualities when required, including confidence in quality control and training activities. I have responded to numerous major disasters and humanitarian crises where I demonstrated a high technical competence and attention to details, with a proven ability to work under pressure on tight deadlines. \n",

      " I received my MEng in summer 2018 from the University of Cambridge. During my vacations from study I have worked for a range of companies. Including very small start-ups, as well as in large multinational companies. My early career began with a gap year working in mechanical engineering for a growing medium sized company in the North East. Despite my limited experience I was able to help improve their engineering processes. This reduce mistakes, sped up delivery times and led to greater standardisation in the engineering department. I transitioned to machine learning during the latter two years of my university course as my interests in programming and signal analysis grew.\n",
      "My course focused heavily on theory, and has left me with strong understanding of broad concepts in machine learning. In my first year after graduation I took a role with a small start-up working on a recommendation engine. This allowed me to learn more about practical, real-world machine learning. I also gained some exposure to the full stack involved in projects and applications. This has helped me appreciate how machine learning fits into the wider product instead of viewing it as a tool working in isolation. To stay up to date with new literature in the field through reading the papers recommended by Imperial College reading groups.\n",
      "As well as completing my projects to a high standard I have a track record for increasing efficiency in the processes and the teams I work with - often having a positive impact on the wider company. \n",

      "The healthcare world is evolving rapidly, from medical products in the last decade, to medical platforms in the current decade focused on real time outcome-based care, to whole medical solutions in the next decade involving robotics, AI and Augmented Reality, focused on preventive care.\n",
      "Through personal contact with people with various healthcare issues I have wanted to realise my passion in the healthcare industry. AI can play a big role in the healthcare industry as ML algorithms are based on data. The available data is very large so I have been working on the research and possible prototypes.\n",
      "I've been working on two projects lately:\n",
      "1. Early diagnosis of skin cancer - using Augmented Reality along with DNN it is possible to detect and track changes in moles with high accuracy. I have been working on submitting two patents.\n",
      "Due to confidentiality I am unable to elaborate further.\n",
      "2. Type 1 diabetes - I have been working on building an end to end data workflow that will use past personal data. using OpenAPS Data Commons to build a model that learns and improves the accuracy of the various parameters (while taking into account biased data, growth, mechanical issues etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience in the tech world, both in the corporate and entrepreneurial world, while building my own startup, allowed me to gained an in depth understanding of dealing with large production environments, strategy and production as well as the analysis and setup of new infrastructure with many constraints and limited resources.\n",

I have strong data analysis and mathematical skills and can write code fluently in Python, Matlab, and Fortran90. I have used Matlab for general data analysis and statistical analysis. During one project based on image processing in Matlab, I performed statistical analysis of the length and distribution of facet lines. I have used Python more recently to apply machine learning techniques to optimise particle accelerators and I am familiar using data analysis modules such as Numpy, MatplotLib, Sklearn, Pandas. In addition I have taken some online courses in order to gain an understanding of TensorFlow and I am continuing to develop skills involving deep learning. I have also helped to develop, code, and implement mathematical and numerical models into existing software, and test that software.\n",

We iterate through the article, calculating a score for each sentence by summing the TF-IDF values for each word appearing in the sentence. We normalize the sentence scores by dividing by the number of tokens in the sentence (to avoid bias in favor of longer sentences). Then we sort the sentences by their scores, and return the highest-scoring sentences as our summary. The number of sentences returned corresponds to roughly 20% of the overall length of the article."
