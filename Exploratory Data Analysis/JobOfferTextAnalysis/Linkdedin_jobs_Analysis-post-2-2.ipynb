    "When I first heard about data science, I did not really sure where should I start and what the path is to become a Data Scientist. After countless hours of research my conclusion about what the job consists of was unclear. What I had discovered in my research was how this job title is rapidly growing into a demanding career option. Living in a time of enormous amounts of data, more and more companies are in demand and looking to fill this position. I began to question, how do you become a data scientist, what degree or level of education do you need, what skills are employers looking for? This lead me to explore the job applications, backgrounds, experiences, and skills that the current data scientist possess. So the data analysis begins!\n",
    "first, I scrape LinkedIn job and I supposed with this I would gather job descriptions and key skills demanding. Second I am going to scrape individuals who land the job as a Data Scientist.\n",
    "For the first part I will go with getting insights from job descriptions. Let ‘s start scraping!\n"

After your first page, to continue scraping on to the next set of 25 job applications you have to get to the next page. Using selenium helped me maneuver around this issue. Selenium has a restriction on its speed because the scraping with the browser is much slower. Due to the slowness, to not get banned by LinkedIn the use of the \"sleep\" statements had to be used in my code multiple times to cause further slow-down.

      " I'm essentially a data enthusiast! Always looking for new challenges whether would it be work, life or hobbies-wise! Following my graduation, I've promptly relocated in NZ where I've worked as Data Analyst for three years, receiving the full sponsorship for the work visa from the company. I'm a passionate and avid learner, with the passion for analytics and machine learning. Being Kaggle one of my favourite hobbies, as at May 2014 I've ranked 14th out of other 170,000 data scientists in the whole community. With the goal of making this hobby my work, I’ve moved to London in 2014 to join Expedia as a Data Scientist. I'm now at Google as Data Science & Machine Learning consultant for their clients!\n",
      "\n",
      "Competing actively on Kaggle, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of real-world projects such as recommend Allstate's car insurance plan configuration, placing 2nd out 1,571 in the contest. Predict the auction price for piece of heavy equipment (2/476). Develop a real-time agent to recommend US domestic plane's route based on the current weather and air traffic condition (8/130). Model the automation of resources’ access for Amazon's employee (25/1687). Estimate how useful Yelp’s reviews will become overtime (15/350). Identify customer \"telematic fingerprint\" capable of distinguishing when a car trip was driven by a given driver (27/1528). Smartphone user recognition based on handset handling (36/633). \n",

      "about:\n",
      " Born in Govan, Glasgow in 1941, Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager of Manchester United in May 2013 following a period of over 26 years at the helm. Over the course of a management career that lasted 39 years, he won 49 major trophies, making him the most successful manager in the history of British football.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made his name with Aberdeen, who became the first club to consistently break the Old Firm dominance of the Scottish game, winning 9 domestic trophies over a 6 year period. But it was victory over Real Madrid in the European Cup-Winners Cup Final in 1983 that brought him to national attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following his move to Manchester United in 1986, he set about restructuring the club and his first trophy in 1990 opened the floodgates. In 2001 he became the first manager to win three championships in a row since the league began in 1888, a feat he repeated in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admired for placing his emphasis on attacking football, with homegrown talent at the heart of his teams, he bowed out as league champion following his 1,500th game in charge of Manchester United.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012, Harvard Business School wrote the case study “Sir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United” before appointing him as a Fellow to the Executive Education Programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following his retirement in 2013 he took up the positions of both Director and Global Ambassador with Manchester United and was also appointed Coaching Ambassador by UEFA. In the same year he released \"My Autobiography\" which became the UK's quickest selling non-fiction book since records began. This work was a follow-up to his first best-selling memoir, \"Managing My Life\", which appeared in 1999.\n",
      "\n",
      "His new Number One bestselling book ‘Leading’, written with Sir Michael Moritz, details the key skills and philosophies he used to deliver success both on and off the field. It will be released in paperback on 19th May. \n",

      " Originally from Canada, I’ve worked closely with professors and colleagues at Western University to conduct research on a myriad of topics, with responsibilities ranging from experiment design to statistical analysis. One of the most interesting studies I’ve led was using eye-tracking equipment to study consumer responses to design elements. During my time in London, UK I have completed a post-graduate program in Data Science at City University.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have since narrowed my focus on areas within machine learning and data science, including use of usage of traditional machine learning algorithms, neural networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and all the slices that make up the AI pie. As of writing, I have over 4 years experience programming in Python, and using the many suites of statistics and machine learning packages (Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, etc). Currently, I'm learning to use Scala in a functional programming framework to aid in the development of distributed machine learning programs with Databricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As dry as it may sound, using machine learning to solve business problems is especially exciting to me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal hobby projects focus on applying stacked ML models to algorithmic trading, and I'm personally very fascinated by reinforcement learning - such a shame that it is not used more widely in traditional industries. \n",

    "That's all we'll need to produce a summary for any document in the corpus. In the example code below, we start by randomly selecting an article from the data science job description database. We iterate through the article, calculating a score for each sentence by summing the TF-IDF values for each word appearing in the sentence. We normalize the sentence scores by dividing by the number of tokens in the sentence (to avoid bias in favor of longer sentences). Then we sort the sentences by their scores, and return the highest-scoring sentences as our summary. The number of sentences returned corresponds to roughly 20% of the overall length of the article."
